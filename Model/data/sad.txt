Sometimes, it feels good to just sit alone, not talking to anyone.
Sometimes I hate getting close to people because I think they will just walk out of my life no matter how close we are.
Some people come in your life just to teach you how to let go.
Nothing hurts more than being disappointed by the person you thought would never hurt you.
That awkward moment when you think you are important to someone, and you are not.
People will usually hurt you in attempt to heal themselves.
I wish people could drink their words and realize how bitter they taste.
People aren't permanent. Remember this and you will be just fine.
And then I think maybe I was designed to be alone.
They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for.
Don't do something permanently stupid just because you are temporarily upset.
Don't promise me things. I don't trust words, I trust actions.
Don't let little stupid things break your happiness.
Don't get upset over things that doesn't matter.
You don't have to accept things you are not okay with.
Whatever makes you feel bad, leave it. Whatever makes you smile, keep it.
Don't stop loving people when you're upset or angry.
Don't keep allowing the same things to upset you. Life's too short to live that way.
Hating people is like burning down your house to kill a rat.
Some people create their own storms, the get upset when it rains.
Do not get upset with people or situations, both are powerless without your reaction.
People will never truly understand something until it happens to them.
Temporary happiness isn't worth long term pain.
The truth hurts for a little while, but lies hurt forever.
I'm not upset that you lied to me, I'm upset that from now on I can't believe you.
I've always done my best for others, while they don't even care about me.
Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.
I will always care for you, even if we're not together and even if we're far, far away from each other.
Missing you comes in waves, and tonight I'm drowning.
We were a perfect match but sadly matches burn.
I did everything right for someone that does everything wrong.
Did I change or did you just stop loving me?
If you love me let me know. If not please gently let me go!
It sucks when you're ignored by the person whose attention is the only thing you want in the world.
Being hurt by someone you love is the worst feeling ever!
I fall too fast that's why I hurt too much.
I would say I'm okay, but I'm done lying.
There's a reason why I keep it all inside.
The quieter you become, the more you can hear.
Brain: Be patient. Heart: Until when?
‘Are you okay?' Always the same question. ‘I'm fine.' Always the same lie.
So many words to say and no ways to say them.
But they all didn't see the lit bit of sadness in me.
Sometimes I don't even understand myself.
Forgive yourself for loving the wrong person.
Stop setting yourself on fire for people who just stand to watch you burn.
No one cares. They're just pretending.
And suddenly, we were strangers again.
Don't waste your time waiting on someone who wouldn't wait for you.
You know my name not my story.
My brain and this world don't fit each other.
My life feels like a test I didn't study for.
Everything is strange. Life. People.
Has never hated life more, than I do at this very moment.
My heart keeps breaking.
No one understands my pain and that hurts!
I feel like everybody secretly hates me.
Sometimes, it feels better not to talk. At all. About anything. To anyone.
It's better to be alone rather than being with someone who makes you feel like you're alone.
When someone makes you an option. Make them a memory.
Never allow someone to be your priority while allowing yourself to be their option.
Well, don't admire people too much. They'll disappoint you sometimes.
Sensitive people suffer more, but they love more and dream more.
The heart was made to be broken.
I've been having a lot of bad days lately.
It hurts because it mattered.
I'm sorry if I changed but you changed too.
I never stopped loving.. I just stopped showing it.
It's sad when someone you know becomes someone you knew.
I am thankful for all those difficult people in my life, they have shown me EXACTLY who I do not want to be!
Time has a wonderful way of showing up what really matters.
Time heals nothing, it just makes your memories fade away.
Say it before you run out of time. Say it before it's too late. Say what you're feeling. Waiting is a mistake.
Sometimes it's not the butterflies that tell you you're in love. But the pain.
The reason it hurts so much to separate is because our souls are connected.
Love can sometimes be magic. But magic can sometimes… just be an illusion.
Every time I start trusting someone, they show me why I shouldn't.
I'm exhausted from trying to be stronger than I feel.
It feels like every other part of my body is broken too.
We try to hide our feelings, but we forgot that our eyes speak.
When your past calls, don't answer. It has nothing new to say.
One of the keys to happiness is a bad memory.
The secret of happiness… is to have bad memory!
Happiness is good health and a bad memory.
Depression is like a war. You either win or die trying.
Pain makes people change.
It's the maybes that will kill you.
I killed a part of me to keep you alive.
I feel I'm missing, something in my life these days.
Most days I miss who I used to be.
If you lose someone but find yourself, you won.
Some people don't change. They just find new ways to lie.
Some humans are really bad at being human.
The saddest thing about betrayal is that it never comes from your enemies.
I have no desire to argue with anyone, I choose to walk away because I just want peace.
I sleep to escape from reality.
Sleeping is nice. You forget about everything for a little while.
Faking a smile is so much easier than explaining why you are sad.
Worrying works! 90% of the things I worry about never happen.
The way sadness works is one of the strangest riddles of the world.
And someday, I hope that my sadness will be replaced by something beautiful.
And it's the road that leads to nowhere. But all I want to do is go there.
The most painful goodbye's are those which were never said and never explained.
The more I find myself, the more people I lose.
Two things I never want to experience again: Broken heart and Deep love.
I lost my mind trying to understand yours.
You don't protect your heart by acting like you don't have one.
And those who are heartless once cared too much.
The strongest hearts have the most scars.
One of the most difficult tasks in life is removing someone from your heart.
Your heart is the most powerful organ. It breaks, heals, and becomes stronger again.
Dear heart, please stop getting involved in Everything. Your job is just to pump blood, So stick to it.
Dear Brain, you were right.
Dear Heart, sorry for the damage.
Dear Pillow, sorry for the tears.
My tears explain the words I fail to speak.
It's hard to answer the question "What's wrong?" when nothing is right.
The worst kind of pain is not being able to tell anyone why you feel it.
Sometimes when I say "I'm okay," I want someone to look me in the eyes, hug me tight, and say, "I know you're not."
If I treated you, the way you treated me, you would hate me.
I wish i could ignore you like you ignore me.
Tough times.. I wish I had a choice..
There's no point in crying, the tears won't bring you back to me.
Pain is the only thing that's telling me, I'm still alive.
You can't break a heart that's already broken!!
Best way to not get your heart broken, is pretend you don't have one.
Tears are how our heart speaks when our lips cannot describe how much we've been hurt.
Tears are prayers too. They travel to God when we can't speak.
Tears come from the heart and not from the brain.
People cry, not because they are weak. It is because they've been strong for too long.
A tear is made of 1% water and 99% feelings.
If you could read my mind, you'd be in tears.
If you could feel what I feel, you'd be in pain.
You broke my heart but I still love you with all the pieces.
Never beg to be loved.
Sometimes it only takes one song to bring back a thousand memories.
Sometimes you will never know the value of a moment until it becomes a memory.
Sometimes it takes losing something to realize what you've had.
If you love something, let it go. If it comes back to you, it's yours forever. If it doesn't, then it was never meant to be.
If you love someone, set them free. If they come back they're yours, if they don't they never were.
Never push a loyal person to the point where they no longer care.
When you are truly comfortable with who you are, not everybody will like you. But you won't care about it one bit.
Everyone is not replaceable. Be careful who you hurt.
Sorry is not enough. Sometimes, you actually have to change.
If you're going to make me cry, at least be there to wipe away the tears.
If my absence doesn't affect your life then my presence has no meaning in it.
I'm tired of fighting. For once, I want to be fought for.
I feel like I'm waiting for something that isn't going to happen.
I'm not heartless, I've just learned how to use my heart less.
I'm not living, I'm just surviving!
Oh, I'm sorry I forgot I only exist when you need something.
I'm that person everyone replaces after a while.
I don't care for Those, who don't care for me.
Stand up for what is right…even if you're standing alone.
It is better to be alone than in bad company.
It's sad to be happy alone in Life..
It's too hard to stay alone in life.
I just need a little time alone…to recharge..
The biggest problem is: I still care
Never hurt people who love you a lot, because they won't hurt you back. But they'll probably have no choice but to leave you forever…
Don't expect me to tell you what you did wrong. If you can't figure it out yourself, then you are not ready to correct it,cos you did not know it was a mistake.
I preferred walking away than fighting for you not because you were not worth fighting for but because you never asked me to stay…
Moving forward in life isn't the hard part, it's leaving behind someone, you thought was meant to move forward with you
Never cry for anyone in your life, because those you cry for don't deserve your tears and those who are deserving will never let you cry.
Seven billion people on this planet and I have 2 friends
I know you won't come back but my heart will take life long time to accept this.
When you are in a habit to talk someone daily, a day without talking to them feels like a year passed
Value the person when they are alive don't cry for them when they are dead.
A magic of songs and sound, When you are happy you just listen the song, but when you are sad you understand the song…
Behind every flirty boy there is a girl who left him alone with no reasons!!
I don't get tired of loving you. I just get tired of waiting, assuming, hearing lies, saying sorry and getting hurt.
The hardest thing to do is watch the person you love, love someone else.
I will never stop caring, but if you decide to push me away, I will go.
It hurts when you have someone in your heart but can't have in your arms….
The more you show your true feelings, the more people find ways to hurt you.
It's amazing how someone break your heart but you still love them with all little broken pieces.
To the less fortunate… life is nothing but a tragedy
204 countries, 805 Islands, 7 seas, 7+ Billion people and I'm single!!!
It's sad when you realize you aren't as important to someone as you thought you were..
Some battles have to be fought alone,Some paths have to be crossed alone, so never be emotionally attached with anyone you never know when you have to walk alone.
Keep smiling… And one day life will become tired of upsetting you
Never become a daughter of a house where there's no mother
One of the biggest mistakes I've ever made was expecting my happiness from others !!
The person who once topped the inbox, now flashes in "people you may know.".!!
Everybody's online, except the one I actually want too.
I take words very seriously, and it breaks my heart when I find out that people don't actually mean what they say.
That sad moment when you realize your childhood is over.
Life seems to be running on a road without any shelter, without any sign board & without any destination.
Sometimes your voice is the medicine to all my diseases.
The worst feeling in the world is knowing that u r no longer that important as u were.
Its very eassy to say BUSSY when Someone needs you…But…. Its very hard to hear BUSSY when you need someone !!!
You don't realise how lonely you r until it's the end of the day and you have a bunch of things to talk about,but no one to Listen !!!
Behind my smile is everything you'll never understand.
No Matter How Hard I Try, No Matter How Many Relationships I Get Into…. It Will Never Replace The One I Just Lost.
I remember the way u used to look at me … and now, I notice the way u ignore me…
The most painful goodbyes are the ones that never said and never explained.
Never expect things to happen. Its better to feel surprised,than to feel disappointed
I don't understand why I still cry for you when you don't even think about me
Sometimes it't not the song that makes you emotional… it's the people and things that come to your mind when you hear it.
I hate how we went from being strangers, to friends, to close friends, to almost sumthing more, to nothing
I don't think you know what you are doing to me.
Me and She makes best couple, but her dad always create trouble
If I had one single wish… I would go back to the moment we kissed
Sadness is when "last seen at" changes to "Online" & again to "last seen at" without reply
If distance is a solution to reduce complications… I want to maintain this distance for eternity
Tears are the last gift of TRUE LOVE…..
Tired of making fake smile.
The good times of today, are the sad thoughts of tomorrow.
Let my soul smile through my heart and my heart smile through my eyes, that I may scatter rich smiles in sad hearts.
Some days are just bad days, that's all. You have to experience sadness to know happiness, and I remind myself that not every day is going to be a good day, that's just the way it is!
It's sad to know I'm done. But looking back, I've got a lot of great memories.
Heavy hearts, like heavy clouds in the sky, are best relieved by the letting of a little water.
Tears come from the heart and not from the brain.
I am closest to my mother, as she is my rock, my pillar of strength, and my world. Not only has she stood by me through all times - happy, sad, and otherwise - but there have even been moments when I had completely lost hope, and her immense belief in me had lifted me up.
It's sad when someone you know becomes someone you knew.
Never make a decision when you are upset, sad, jealous or in love.
The word 'happy' would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness.
First, accept sadness. Realize that without losing, winning isn't so great.
There is a sacredness in tears. They are not the mark of weakness, but of power. They speak more eloquently than ten thousand tongues. They are the messengers of overwhelming grief, of deep contrition, and of unspeakable love.
I do believe that if you haven't learnt about sadness, you cannot appreciate happiness.
Depression is the inability to construct a future
Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.
Grief is never something you get over. You don't wake up one morning and say, 'I've conquered that; now I'm moving on.' It's something that walks beside you every day. And if you can learn how to manage it and honour the person that you miss, you can take something that is incredibly sad and have some form of positivity.
It's time to say goodbye, but I think goodbyes are sad and I'd much rather say hello. Hello to a new adventure.
Crying is cleansing. There's a reason for tears, happiness or sadness.
When you wake up each morning, you can choose to be happy or choose to be sad. Unless some terrible catastrophe has occurred the night before, it is pretty much up to you. Tomorrow morning, when the sun shines through your window, choose to make it a happy day.
Don't grieve. Anything you lose comes round in another form.
Red is the ultimate cure for sadness.
Everyone can have their heart broken. Even if you know the relationship isn't working, it's still sad. Even in a bad relationship, they're part of your life for a long time, and saying goodbye to that can be difficult.
The walls we build around us to keep sadness out also keeps out the joy.
Worry never robs tomorrow of its sorrow, it only saps today of its joy.
Dying is only one thing to be sad over... Living unhappily is something else.
You can never control who you fall in love with, even when you're in the most sad, confused time of your life. You don't fall in love with people because they're fun. It just happens.
